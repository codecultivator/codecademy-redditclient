# Find Your Hat

This repo was created in response to the [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) **Portfolio Project: Reddit Client** challenge project I encountered along the way through the _Full Stack Engineer_ course.

## Project Goals
1. Build the application using React and Redux.

2. Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub.

3. Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work.

4. Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
 - Wireframes
 - Technologies used
 - Features
 - Future work


## Install

```
npm install
```
